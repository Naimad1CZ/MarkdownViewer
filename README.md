# Markdown Viewer #

**A clean, quick and simple Markdown viewer for Windows.**

Internally, the Markdown is converted to HTML using [MarkdownSharp](https://code.google.com/archive/p/markdownsharp/), customized to format github style code blocks.

The HTML is rendered in an internal Chromium instance created with [CEFSharp](https://github.com/cefsharp/CefSharp).

The HTML is styled with [Bootstrap 3](http://getbootstrap.com/), and the code blocks are syntax highlighted with [SyntaxHighlighter](http://alexgorbatchev.com/SyntaxHighlighter/).
